    <b><li>The Reclining Buddha is a representation of Buddha, just before he passed into the afterlife, lying on his side, with a calm and content expression. The statue was built in remembrance of his death and can be seen not only in Wat Pho but in several other temples in Thailand. Due to the size of Wat Pho’s Reclining Buddha, it is difficult to get a picture capturing the full length of the statue. Nonetheless, its awesomeness can never really be captured in a picture. You would have to see the real thing to appreciate just how grand it is.</b><br><br>
